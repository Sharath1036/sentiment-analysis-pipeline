I received no scholarships."
"These placement or recruitment activities are held on the campus of the college or institute you are studying in. The college invites the companies and companies that to come and interview students to gauge their potential as future employees. Companies may use their own form of the interview process. Post the interviews, they make selections.The infrastructure is absolutely magnificent. The hospital and academic building have been newly constructed and, explicitly cleaned lecture theatres, corridors, wards, and hygienic washrooms.
Other: Various field trips, scholarships, programs, societies, seminars, and conferences are run from time to time on the college campus for students."

They are also good at practical and technical knowledge for teaching us .they are very friendly with students and encourage us for every low and up.
"From college, you will be asked for an internship in the second-year third semester. Doing intercity gives you a lot of experience, which increases your chances of getting more salary in the job.
That's why an internship is necessary.Sri Bhavani Niketan College is the best college in Jaipur.  So far this college has got the best placements in Jaipur.  Its most important thing is that it is good enough for engineering. A hostel facility is also provided in this."
"Here the 6th-semester student is eligible for campus placement.
Here Tata consultancy services, Wipro, HCL company arrives for the placement of students.
Here the highest package is 30 lpa and avg package is 5 lpa.
Here almost 70-80% of students get placement in service-based companies.
I have planned to do MTech.1. I have chosen btech in the CSE department.
2. There are 2 faculty per 60 students.
3. All faculty are either BPSC-qualified or gate qualified.
4. Exams are conducted per 6 months If someone has good coverage of the syllabus then they can pass easily."
"For internships, college is tied up with some industries and companies for better training for their students and the development of interpersonal skills and technical skills. Besides the industrial visit college also provides some online internship platforms like Cisco.The placement scenario is getting better than before. Since 2015 the placement cell has worked very hard and helped the students to achieve their dream jobs in prestigious companies. those students who could not place prefer to go for a government job."
"I chose Computer science and engineering because it is the best course in this college and the placement of this branch is the maximum in it so I opted for this branch this college is ranked no. 1 in Bihar engineering colleges so I took admitted to it.  Faculty members are average and there is a severe lack of good faculty members only a few of the faculty members are good but others are average and we have to rely on our own for any preparation.  Term exams are held on time and the difficulty of papers were good questions are asked from all topics.College life is very good and hostel life is excellent like nits and IITS  but for newly admitted students ragging is the worst problem ragging is very much in the first year for 2-3 months of the freshly admitted students.  For books, there is a huge library in which all books are available.  Many functions are also organized month to month in this college approx 3-4 functions this college organizes per year. This college has a sports facility and a gym facility but very old equipment is present in the gym."
"I got to know that the Mechanical branch of NIT Rourkela is one of the best branches. I had little interest in machine stuff, so I decided to join. I would have got EE and EI as well, but I choose Mechanical. Now I regret my decision. Because most of the Mechanical Engineering Department teachers are too bad at teaching simultaneously I lost my interest in it.It's a myth that all students get placed and never trust an Average package. That seems good because of some software placements. CSE, ECE, EI, and EE students are those who mostly get the opportunity to get placed in the IT sector. And the core placement is not that good."
"College exams are not that difficult, if you study well, you can easily pass that, so no worries about that. The teachers are very good in their respective subjects and it makes students industry ready The provide so many training during your college. Teachers were knowledgeable and qualified, and everyone was GATE qualified few of them were from NIT and prestigious colleges.Students got placed in reputed companies like TCS, Wipro, Infosys, Cognizant, L&T INFOTECH, Persistent, KPIT Technologies, Zycus, Zensar, Hexaware, Mphasis, and many more. Special training sessions are also arranged to groom the skills of the students for specific technologies as required by the companies visiting us."

Better faculty and student ratio.
All faculty are well qualified and get jobs at bpsc.
The exam is taken on time and it is a little bit hard there is no chance of cheating in the semester exam.An annual fest called Technology takes place every year in the month of February in which artist comes to perform there is a DJ show and a sports event that takes place every year in the winter season.

It is not difficult to pass. It has mid sem exam and a sem exam. it has affiliated with Bihar engineering university. which is located in Patna. it is situated on the bank of the river Ganga. All students take a bath in Ganga before every exam.It has a campus area of 200 acre. which is very big all students enjoy in the evening.

The highest package was for 54 LPA while the average package was around 7 LPA. Around 80-90 percent of students got placed.Once you are enrolled in a course your fees will not be hiked for the whole duration. The cost of the study is quite affordable. There are several scholarship schemes but the best is to get a scholarship through the CUCET exam conducted by the university. Students can also apply for loans from the university. Regarding campus jobs, to my knowledge, I don't think there is such a thing."
"Life at YMCA is average in my opinion there are many activities that can give a boost to our minds but I don't think there are things that can make life fun, amenities in the classroom are also average there are no air conditioners though the classes are spacious. culmyca is the fest that happens every year but it not happened for 2 years There are many club activities and clubs available in college. but mostly are technical ,cultural activities are very less.I chose mechanical engineering because I have a great passion for the subjects I wanted to explore and gain practical knowledge about how machines and various other stuff are made.
